But for now, I'm just trying to read a dictionary in a text file 
into an array :-)
*********************************************************************/  

//Create an app that will take a word (or series of letters) and find all the words in the dictionary file that can be made from those letters.
    //Create a program that will take a base word and will return all the words that can be made from the letters of the base word
        //Create a way to read all the words from a dictionary .txt file into an array


#include "BaseWord.hpp"
#include <string>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include "Dictionary.hpp"

using std::string;
using std::ifstream;

void readDict();

int main(){
    Dictionary dict;
    return 0;
}
